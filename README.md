I've been a front-end developer for more than 16 years. My area of expertise is creating web applications with JavaScript and other frontend tools. I have a history of producing top-notch outcomes and have worked on a number of large-scale projects for numerous clients.
Creating complicated Web apps, designing custom user interfaces, and creating backend services are all things I've done in the past. I have a strong sense of organization and the capacity to operate both alone and collaboratively. I also have great problem-solving abilities and the capacity to complete tasks on time without compromising quality. I'm dedicated to delivering the best possible job, and I aim for perfection in whatever I do.
As a part of My Achievement, I was initially engaged at Minds - Web Solution Company as a Web Designer, but because to my technical and administrative abilities, I quickly advanced to the position of Web Manager. 
My areas of expertise include problem solving, domain driven design, responsive design principles, and website optimization. I also have a rapid learning curve for new programming languages and talents. I currently have experience in ReactJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Laravel, Bootstrap, Grunt, Jira, Azure DevOps, and Git/GitHub. I'm still eagerly clinging to any additional programming languages, frameworks, or ideas I can include into the mental web of code.
Please feel free to get in touch with me if you'd want to connect. I'm always interested in hearing from previous coworkers, managers, or just intriguing creative people.

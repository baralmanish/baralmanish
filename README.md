I am a Full-stack Developer with 8 years of professional experience in using JavaScript & TypeScript (React, Angular, NodeJS). Currently Iâ€™m part of an agile development team where Iâ€™m in charge of developing highly scaleable and reliable applications using React, Redux, NodeJS & Azure DevOps in multiple environments including microservices and atomic design patterns.

I love working with leading technologies like NextJS | VueJS | React Native | GraphQL | Laravel | MySQL | PostgreSQL | Microservices | Docker | Kubernetes | AWS | CI/CD | Redis | Pusher | Scrum | DevOps | Agile Methodologies | Microsoft PowerApps | Shopify.

I have experience working in a variety of sectors for American and Danish startups, like FleetPanda, in an environment that is constantly growing. I have a great interest for developing and debugging distributed systems that are dependable, highly available, secure, and performant. As I pick things up quickly, I enjoy taking on new challenges.
